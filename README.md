# FYI

This example is modified base on [THIS POST](https://codeburst.io/jwt-authorization-in-flask-c63c1acf4eeb)

I replaced the depending packages with the latest JWT 4.0 version, as some of the decorators name ware changed in the latest version.

You can find the details in [CHANGE GUIDE](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/v4_upgrade_guide/)
